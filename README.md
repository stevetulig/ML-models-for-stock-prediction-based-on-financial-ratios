# ML-models-for-stock-prediction-based-on-financial-ratios
This repository includes python code modules and a Jupyter Notebook
with output for my attempts to fit and apply six machine learnings
to predict winners and losers on the Australian Stock Exchange
The data used comes from a SQL-Server database
and is pulled in using....
For other preliminary work in SQL Server see my other repository...
I need to update the data
and include a few other ratios pertaining to Accruals, Merton Model (Distance to Default)
and more valuation-relevant ratios
Generally, the models don't work as well as a naive model which doesn't require any fitting
