# ML-models-for-stock-prediction-based-on-financial-ratios
This repository includes a writeup, python code modules and a Jupyter Notebook
with output for my attempts to fit and apply six machine learnings
to predict winners and losers on the Australian Stock Exchange.

Generally, the models don't work as well as a naive model which doesn't require any fitting.

The data used comes from a SQL-Server database. For other preliminary work relating
to this database see the repository https://github.com/stevetulig/SQL-Server-database-details-queries-for-ratio-manipulation

The data needs to be updated.
A few other ratios need to be added pertaining to Accruals, Distance to Default, and more valuation-relevant ratios
